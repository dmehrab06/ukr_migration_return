# Ukr_migration_return

Scripts for estimating return migration from Ukraine. 

For running the best model, one should refer to the scripts in `return_model_variations/GlobalConflictKMaxLaggedPeer/lag-30-roll-7`. Most of the results reported in the paper are from the scripts in `return_model_variations/GlobalConflictKMaxLaggedPeer/`. The optimizers have not been uploaded since they are quite large (4.0T in total). However, a checkpoint optimizer can be requested by email.

The repository is still under development, so some input data may be missing. If you are trying to run and need some data, request it by an email to dmehrab94@gmail.com or zm8bh@virginia.edu
